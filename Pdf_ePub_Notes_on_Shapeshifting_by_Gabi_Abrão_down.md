Abrāo’s work has been described by The Outline as “an existential funhouse of familiar thoughts” that “publicly grapples with pillars of its own existence within the influencer economy.” Alongside The Outline, her work has been featured in publications such as The Atlantic, Dazed, The Harvard Crimson, and The Face, among others. In response to Abrāo’s work, Dazed Magazine wrote, “Gabi debunks the myth that wellness is the preserve of the privileged, and in doing so hands it back to the masses,” and Notes on Shapeshifting is a reminder that we are agents of the change that we seek.  Gabi Abrāo’s Notes on Shapeshifting is an ode to existing in physical form, fully aware of the changing energy that flows through every aspect of it. As Abrāo writes, “tapping into the ether body to take a break from the demands of the earth body, / making peace with ephemerality, / lightness, / shapeshifting”. Throughout this collection, you are invited to travel through various states; pure infatuation to heartbreak, confidence to defeat, from a skepticism for living to a full-on trust in it. And Notes on Shapeshifting yearns to soothe and arouse along the way.
