Overview
When it comes to romance, sometimes it doesn&#039;t hurt to play games. A fun YA romcom full of fake dating hijinks!
 
 Musical lover Riley has big aspirations to become a director on Broadway. Crucial to this plan is to bring back her high schoolâ€™s spring musical, but when Riley takes her momâ€™s car without permission, she&#039;s grounded and stuck with the worst punishment: spending her after-school hours working at her dadâ€™s game shop.
 
 Riley can&#039;t waste her time working when she has a musical to save, so she convinces Nathanâ€”a nerdy teen employeeâ€”to cover her shifts and, in exchange, sheâ€™ll flirt with him to make his gamer-girl crush jealous.
 
 But Riley didnâ€™t realize that meant joining Nathan&#039;s Dungeons &amp; Dragons gameâ€¦or that role playing would be so fun. Soon, Riley starts to think that flirting with Nathan doesn&#039;t require as much acting as she would&#039;ve thought...
