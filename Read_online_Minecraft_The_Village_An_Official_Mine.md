Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller The expansive Minecraft universe is a cultural phenomenon, and the novel trilogy is just one facet of it. Max Brooks brings this series home in spectacular fashion with a rewarding adventure that will delight the multitude of fans out there. The final book in Max Brooksâ€™s official Minecraft trilogy! The New York Times bestselling author of Minecraft: The Island details the story of two stranded heroes whose block-breaking expedition lands them squarely in the middle of a conflict that only they can resolve.
 
 Journeying into the unknown is a scary prospect, but together Guy and Summer can navigate any challenge. The two castaways strike out in this curious, blocky world, searching for a way home. As they cross the Overworldâ€”traversing frozen wastelands and scorching desertsâ€”the pair makes an exciting discovery: a community populated by villagers!
 Â 
 Guy and Summer settle in to learn more about their new friends, trading with the residents and exploring the surrounding area as they work out the next steps in their voyage. But with monstrous mobs and perilous pitfalls around every corner, they soon find that they might be needed here more than theyâ€™d thought.
 Â 
 When a villager disappears, their investigation uncovers new foesâ€”ones so powerful that this might spell the end of their adventure. Drawing on the lessons theyâ€™ve learned along the way, Guy and Summer must work together to protect the village.
